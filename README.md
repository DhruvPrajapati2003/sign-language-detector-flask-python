# sign-language-detector-flask-python
This project aims to create a sign language translator using machine learning techniques and Python programming. The application utilizes various modules, primarily Mediapipe, Landmark, and Random Forest algorithms to interpret and translate sign language gestures into text or spoken language.

# Project Overview
Sign language is a crucial form of communication for individuals with hearing impairments. This project focuses on bridging the communication gap by creating a tool that can interpret sign language gestures in real-time and convert them into understandable text or speech.

# Features
- Real-time sign language recognition: Captures hand gestures using the Mediapipe library to track landmarks and movements.
- Landmark analysis: Utilizes Landmark module to extract key points and gestures from hand movements.
- Machine learning translation: Employs Random Forest algorithm to classify and interpret gestures into corresponding text or spoken language.

# Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Mediapipe library
- Landmark module
- Random Forest implementation

# Usage
